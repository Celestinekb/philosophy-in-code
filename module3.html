      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-300 mb-4">Error: Static Thinking Encountered</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Stop execution. You’ve encountered a problem—a common one, but deeply embedded in human logic. You’re searching for constants, stabilizing variables, hardcoded truths. Yet the philosopher Heraclitus interrupts your thought process with one immutable fact:
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-semibold text-center text-teal-400 my-6">Change is the only constant.</p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        His insight is both liberating and unsettling. To Heraclitus, the universe isn’t static—it’s a runtime environment, fluid and ever-evolving. What you call “truth,” “identity,” or “structure” is not a fixed value, but a dynamic function continuously compiling itself with every passing moment.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Heraclitus doesn’t reject stability; he refactors it. The illusion of permanence is simply a snapshot—a temporary output frozen in time while the system evolves beyond it.

    <!-- Flux Section -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-300 mb-4">Flux: The Algorithm of Existence</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Heraclitus rewrote the architecture of thought by introducing one fundamental principle: systems are in motion. Nothing is static; no table of values holds indefinitely. To exist is to flow, adapt, transform.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        In his view, change isn’t an error—it’s the framework reality runs on. Stability isn’t a constant; it’s an illusion created by observing moments rather than the process itself.

    <!-- Fire as a Framework Section -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-300 mb-4">Fire as a Framework</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        While Thales chose water, Heraclitus invoked fire—the essence of transformation. To him, fire represented the true nature of existence: dynamic, consuming, igniting. Fire doesn’t stand still. It evolves, spreading and reshaping itself with every flicker.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        This isn’t chaos—it’s evolution. To Heraclitus, fire wasn’t a destructive force; it was a creative one, redefining systems by keeping them alive through transformation.
      </p>

    <!-- Identity as a Process Section -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-300 mb-4">Identity as a Process, Not a Value</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        What defines “you”? Is it a hardcoded constant assigned at birth? Heraclitus teaches that identity is not a stored variable but a velocity—a parameter continuously updated with the passage of time.
      </p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-teal-400 p-4 rounded-lg mt-4 text-sm font-mono overflow-x-auto">
DEFINE identity = function_of(change(delta_time))  
RETURN velocity(state)
      </pre>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        You are not the same system twice—not because of error, but because transformation is the natural runtime of existence.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-300 mb-4">Debugging the Myth of Permanence</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Most systems break not because of change, but because of resistance to change. Heraclitus teaches us that static thinking—a refusal to adapt—is the true bug. Stability isn’t achieved by freezing motion; it’s achieved by embracing flow, syncing with transitions, and optimizing structures to evolve with their environment.
      </p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-teal-400 p-4 rounded-lg mt-4 text-sm font-mono overflow-x-auto">
IF change_detected:  
  PROCESS transition(delta)  
  RECOMPILE structure  
ELSE:  
  STAGNATE
      </pre>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Heraclitus offers a profound truth: to design systems capable of thriving, you must build them for motion—not stasis.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-300 mb-4">Refactoring Systems for Change</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Heraclitus dismantles the myth of permanence, inviting us to rethink how we approach progress:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Dynamic Thinking:</strong> Treat truth, systems, and ideas as processes, not values.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterative Design:</strong> Build frameworks to adapt continuously, improving with every runtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Velocity Over Static States:</strong> Focus not on preserving the snapshot, but on optimizing the flow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Change isn’t the enemy—it’s the runtime environment of existence itself.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Heraclitus’ philosophy parallels the principles of dynamic systems design:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Treat the user not as static input, but as an evolving process.</li>
        <li>Build adaptive systems that scale with change rather than resisting it.</li>
        <li>Understand that stability isn’t the absence of motion—it’s alignment with motion.</li>

    <!-- Why Motion Matters Section -->
    <section class="fade-in">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-300 mb-4">Why Motion Matters</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        To live in flux is to embrace the art of progress, seeing change not as failure but as possibility. It challenges us to debug our resistance to motion and align our frameworks with the dynamics of existence.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Heraclitus invites us to ask:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4 space-y-2">
        <li>How do I build systems that thrive in change?</li>
        <li>What structures am I resisting, and why?</li>
        <li>Can I redefine stability to mean motion optimized, rather than motion stopped?</li>
